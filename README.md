# twilio-sms-test

When I sent the message to my phone(a verified number), the Twilio SMS sending feature worked as expected (I received the message).

With unverified numbers, like the ones listed in the test, I'm getting the 21608 error code (he number  is unverified. Trial accounts cannot send messages to unverified numbers; verify  at twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/verified, or purchase a Twilio number to send messages to unverified numbers)  I would need to upgrade my twilio account to a paid one or verify the numbers I want to send the message to(I would need to have access to the phsyical cellphone to verify the number via SMS)
